- This dashboard helps analyze critical metrics such as:
  - Number of Patients – Total count per day with area sparklines to identify peak days and trends.
  - Average Wait Time – Shows how long patients wait before being seen. Spot delays and optimize staffing.
  - Patient Satisfaction Score – Visualizes satisfaction levels daily to assess quality of care.
  - Interactive Charts & Insights:
  - Admission Status: Tracks % of admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
  - Age Group Distribution: Helps identify which age groups visit the ER most often.
  -Timeliness: Measures % of patients seen within 30 minutes.
  - Gender-wise Analysis: Compares ER visits by male vs. female patients.
  - Department Referrals: Highlights which departments patients are referred to most – like General Practice, Orthopedics, and Cardiology.

## Tools Used
